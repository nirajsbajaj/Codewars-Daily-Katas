# Codewars-Daily-Katas
This repository is a daily practice log of Codewars kata solved in JavaScript, with an emphasis on how I approach problems, not just the final answers.

Rather than treating kata as isolated one-file solutions, I focus on breaking problems down, reasoning through them in plain English first, and then translating that reasoning into code.

**Purpose of this repository**
  Practice JavaScript fundamentals consistently
  Improve problem decomposition skills
  Develop a habit of reasoning before coding
  Make the learning process visible and intentional

Each kata here is treated as a small problem-solving exercise rather than a code-golf challenge.

**How I work through a kata**
Before writing the final solution, I typically:
  Write a plain-English breakdown of the problem to clarify intent and constraints.
  Identify smaller sub-problems and solve them in isolation when necessary.
  Use separate files when a concept needs to be understood independently.
  Combine those pieces into a final, readable solution.

In some cases, intermediate files are kept intentionally to document this thinking process.

**Repository structure**
  Each folder or file corresponds to a Codewars kata or a specific practice session.
  When multiple files exist for a kata, they represent incremental steps in reasoning, not accidental leftovers.
  The final solution is always clearly identifiable.

**Language and Platform**
  Language: JavaScript
  Platform: Codewars
