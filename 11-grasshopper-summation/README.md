# Summation of Numbers from 1 to N

## Overview

This program calculates the summation of all positive integers starting from **1** up to a given numver **n**, inclusive. The input is guaranteed to be a positive integer greater than zero.

For example:
- If the input is `2`, the result is `3`
- If the input is `8`, the result is `36`

The goal is to return only the final summation value.

## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `n`, compute the sum of all integers from `1` to `n`.

---

## How It Works

- Start with an initial total of zero
- Begin counting from `1`
- Add each number to the running total
- Stop once the cont reaches the input number
- Return the final total
